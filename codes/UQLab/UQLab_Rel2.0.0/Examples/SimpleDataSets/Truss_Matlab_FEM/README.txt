DATASET DESCRIPTION:

Origin/references:
--------------------------
  Origin:
    The dataset originates from in-house code related to the analysis of the 
     mid-span deflection of a truss structure. 
  
  More information about the truss structure model can be found at the reference below.

Dataset description:
--------------------------
  The dataset is divided into 200 samples to be used as an experimental design, and 
  1000 samples to be used for validation. 
 
  The experimental design was generated by Monte Carlo sampling. The model responses were obtained
  by an in-house FEM code.
