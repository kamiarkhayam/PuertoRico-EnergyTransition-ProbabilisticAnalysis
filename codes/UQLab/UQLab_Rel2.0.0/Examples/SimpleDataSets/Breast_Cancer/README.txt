Dataset description:
--------------------------
  The input variables are related to features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine 
  needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.  
 
  The output of interest is the associated diagnosis which is either malignant (y=-1) or benign (y=1).
